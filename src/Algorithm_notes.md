### Why the algorithm is a bit mathematically hacky


First note that 
- $\mu_1 \geq 0$
- $\mu_1 K_1(x,u) = 0$.

Now if the second equation is equal to zero all the time (which would be true if the curve never 'pointed back' on itself), then

- $\lambda$ would be a pure integrator of the cost gradient
- $\lambda$ would be proportional to $\dot{\theta}$

$\mu_2$

$\theta$

$\lambda$

$$ \mu_1 (\mu_2,\lambda, \theta )  $$
